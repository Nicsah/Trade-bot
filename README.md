# Trade-bot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My project is to do trading bot to financial markets, which is profitable to use.
It will be practiced by historical data and use it for future predictions.


## Background

* AI has no emotions and computer can be programmed to work more accurate than human.
* I am very intrested in finance and programming, so i want to make them work together.
* If I learn more programming and thinking from my freetime hobby, it helps me out in my studies.


## How is it used?

Trade bot can be used all the time when financial markets are open.

Needs for using it is just access to financial markets, and little money, there is no limits how much.

Bot will automatically buy and sell stocks


## Data sources and AI methods

Data will be gathered mostly from stock history.


## Challenges

* Trade bot will not be able to predict if there happens very big moves in short time in stock market.
* It can take negative trades because predicting future for 100% is impossible 


## What next?

* I need to be better programmer and with AI, so I will study them more.
* I need to improve also with math for predictions.
